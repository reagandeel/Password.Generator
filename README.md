To access your secure password, you will select the 'Generate' button. This will then have a pop-up of a series of prompts in order to get your generated password.
The first option will prompt you to select a number of characters for your password between 8-128. If you do not select a number between 8-128, it will then remind you to do so. If you input anything other than a number, it will prompt you to enter a number.

After you select the length of characters for your password, it will then prompt you to confirm you will select lower case letters. Next, it will do the same for upper case letters, numbers within the password, and special characters.

After you complete the series of prompts, it will then generate your new secure password.
